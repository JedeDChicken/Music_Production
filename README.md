# Music Production practices, song remakes

*This repository includes my remakes of the instrumentals of famous songs. First, I extracted the vocals from the original tracks using Splitter AI then layered the vocals on top of the remade instrumentals. These projects allowed me to apply Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques especially when engineering sounds and synths (layering simple waveforms such as sine and saw waves using synthesizers like Serum or Vital, an application of Fourier synthesis and Harmonics), and in mixing that involves signal chains incorporating key DSP concepts such as compression, equalization/filtering, distortion, noise (like Additive Gaussian White Noise [AGWN]), modulation (for effects like chorus, phaser, and delay), and convolution (for reverb).
